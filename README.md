# dotfiles
These are all of my personal dotfiles that I use.
Feel free to use them and/or make them your own!

## setup
```
git clone https://github.com/whoisronnoc/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup
```
The setup script automatically creates the correct symlinks from your home directory to wherever you cloned the repository.
It also backs up your current configs just in case you still wanted them.
